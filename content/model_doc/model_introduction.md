Regional MOM6 introduction

##  What is regional MOM6
The Modular Ocean Model (MOM) is a state-of-the-art numerical model for oceanic climate and climate change studies. Itâ€™s developed by the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) under the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The model is designed to be flexible and versatile, making it adaptable to a wide range of oceanic research topics. Here is a [great documentation](https://mom-ocean.github.io) talking about the differen version of MOM.
>The Modular Ocean Model (MOM) describes the numerical ocean models originating from NOAA/GFDL. They are used to simulate ocean currents at both regional and global scales, enabling scientists to answer fundamental questions about the role of the ocean in the dynamics of the global climate.

>MOM6 is the latest version of MOM. It blends the techniques of traditional solvers with a dynamic vertical coordinate. Development is led by an international consortium of scientists across several goverment agencies and academic institutions.

The Regional MOM6 is an extension of the Global MOM6, specifically designed to focus on high-resolution simulations of various distinct regions. This model allows for more detailed and localized studies of oceanic phenomena.

The Global MOM6, developed by NOAA/GFDL, serves as the foundation for this regional variant. The Regional MOM6 enhances this foundation by providing the capability to design and implement models for specific regions. This allows for a more granular analysis of regional oceanic conditions and phenomena.

There are numerous online resources available for both MOM6 and its regional variant. These resources provide valuable information, tutorials, and documentation to assist users in effectively utilizing these models for their research needs.
